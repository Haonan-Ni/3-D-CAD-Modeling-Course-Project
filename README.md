# 3-D-CAD-Modeling-Course-Project
## Project Introduction
      This project is to realize the five basic Euler operations based on the half-edge data structure according to the requirement of the final course project of 3D CAD modeling delivered by Prof. Gao. In the project, the Euler operations, along with the extra “Sweep (Extrusion)” operation based on the half-edge data structure have been defined and programmed in C++ to represent the topological relations of vertex, edge, and faces. In addition, the sweeping function allows for multiple inner rings on 2D sketch. However, because I was unfamiliar with OpenGL and couldn’t get it to work properly anyhow, too much time was wasted previously in vain and I finally decided to use a public open software MeshFramework for model viewing after topological generation (possibly minus points for lack of programming work)。
